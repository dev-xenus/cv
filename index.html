          <p>
            I am currently working as a Customer Service Representative. I have
            a Bachelor's Degree in Teaching English and German as a Foreign
            Language. I have decided to change my occupation to IT and started
            learning Python online recently. I am an aspiring developer who
            would like to be financially independent and travel all around the
            world. Web Development is something I am vaguely aware of as I have
            watched some courses on it. I feel like programming with Python is
            much more interesting though, because I feel that the result is much
            more useful and practical than a beautiful webpage.
